Some lines of code to follow this great tutorial https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/

The code was executed in a machine with a processor AMD® Pro a12-9800b r7, 12 compute cores 4c+8g × 4. Also, it was tested using Python 3.8.3. To run the code, you need to install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt` (just [codetiming](https://pypi.org/project/codetiming/) and [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/)). The codes is a bit different to those one explained in the tutorial.

In the folder `stats`, you can find some statistics for the 4 different versions of the code.
